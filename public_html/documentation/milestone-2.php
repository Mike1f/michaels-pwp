		<h1>Wireframe & Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>I want this site to be a site where employers can look at my professional skills as well as find out what kind
			of person I am and what my personality is like. It will have a description on what kind of person
			I am along with my interests and personality.</p>
		<p>When they get to the top of the site it will show an "About Me" section where it will have information on just
			that. At the top of the page where the header is, it will have little tabs where they can
			navigate the rest of the site and choose to see my Portfolio, Resume, and my Contact information.</p>
			<p>As you scroll down the screen the second section is going to have my Portfolio with information on my
			Quantitative & Qualitative skills & accomplishments. Has click-able links</p>
		<p>The third section will have a copy of my Resume so Employers can see my professional accomplishments and passed
			experience as well as my professional skills.Also has click-able links</p>
		<p>The fourth and last section will be a section where employers can contact me. There will be two boxes where
			they can put their email address and send me email messages. There will also be social media icons that when clicked on will
			send them to my profile that corresponds to said social media outlets.</p>
