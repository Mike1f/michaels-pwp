		<p>I want this site to be a site where employers can look at my professional skills as well as find out what kind
			of person I am and what my personality is like. When they get to the homepage of the site it will show an
			"About Me" page where it will have information on just that. It will have a description on what kind of person
			I am along with my interests and personality. At the top of the page it will have little tabs where they can
			navigate the rest of the site and choose to se my Portfolio, Resume, and my Contact information. The same goes
			for the mobile version of the site the only major difference being the tabs will com up from a little side bar
			when a "Hamburger" button is tapped.</p>
