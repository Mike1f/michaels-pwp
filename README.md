This project will help me define the direction of my Personal website.

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtfully defined and you have a solid direction laid out for your work ahead - nice job.

Your project is set up correctly, and overall your code looks pretty good, but there were a couple of errors. Have a look at Edits &amp; Suggestions below. You're ready to begin work on Milestone 2a, and I look forward to seeing your design and content ideas take shape!

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) (Submitted late, within one day of due date/time).

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- You're missing the `<head>` tag. That should contain both the `<title>` and `<meta>` tags. See: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/html/
- Super tiny detail - line 2 of your .gitignore needs to be `.DS_Store` (the dot is missing)
- Lines 20-25: These don't all need to be `<ul>`s. Ideally they should all be `<li>`s inside one `<ul>`... like so:
```
<ul>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
```
